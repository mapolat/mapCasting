    ####################

    !!! IMPORTANT NOTE !!!

    In mapCasting Smarty Template engine is used. Still some changes must be
    made in order to work.

    The Webserver must have write access for following directories
    '/include/smarty/cache' and '/include/smarty/templates_c'

    It is recommended (but not mandatory) to place these directories outside of
    the web server's document root.

    The same for these directories '/include/smarty/templates' and
    '/include/smarty/configs'

    You must notify mapCasting about the changes

    In '/include/smarty.inc.php' change following variable:
    $Templateroot and $Cacheroot from $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."mapCasting";
	
    to something like:

    $smarty->template_dir = "/var/www/include/smarty/templates";
    $smarty->config_dir = "/var/www/include/smarty/configs";
    $smarty->compile_dir = "/var/www/include/smarty/templates_c";
    $smarty->cache_dir = "/var/www/include/smarty/cache";

    More information about Smarty at Link: http://www.smarty.net/

    Create Database:

    ####################

    mysqladmin -u 'user name' -p create mapcasting

    Create tables:
    mysql -u 'user name' -p mapcasting < mapcasting_1_0_0.sql

    If you have no 'root' access, please use 'phpMyAdmin'

    First create database, then select the data base, then select Import,Location
    of the text file: select suitable file: mapCasting_1_0_0.sql, then select
    Character set of the file: 'latin1' and click on Go.

    You will see a message something like this:

    Import has been successfully finished, 127 queries executed.

    !!! IMPORTANT NOTE !!!

    Please don't insert the SQL file into the field Run SQL query/queries on
    database. The data will be inserted without any errors, but thereafter, a
    login is no longer possible.


    The following files must be changed in order to access your new database
    'mapcasting'.

    In the directory ' /include '

    'dbconf.php' for the data base connection
    _DBHOST z. B. "localhost"
    _DBUSER z. B. "username"
    _DBPASS z. B. "userpassword"
    _DBNAME z. B. "phpinvoice"

    _DBUSER must have enough rights on your Data base server - SELECT, INSERT,
    UPDATE, DELETE

    'mapcasting.inc.php' ( importantly is the variable "$web" please enter your
    own Web address where you copy mapCasting_1_0_0 ) e.g.
    http://yourserver/mapCasting ( without '/' at the end ) otherwise the
    forwarding will not work.

    For users who run mapCasting on a Windows server, please adapt under
    Configuration/Settings TMP-Directory.

    Standard is '/tmp/' in e. g. 'c:\windows\temp\'

    Please consider the last backslash. Importantly. The Web server must have
    write access for this directory.

    On Windows servers please also examine 'session.save_path'

    Standard is session.save_path = /tmp

    In this case, please change it in e.g. session.save_path = c:\windows\temp

    Login:

    Administrator: admin, admin

    The user data are stored encrypted in the table 'user'

    After the first login you will be prompted to accept the mapCasting License
    ( GPL V2 ). This is needed only once per user.

    The administrator password can be changed only the user name 'admin' may not
    be changed. Otherwise you will not be able to access many sites.
